# Action unit blendshape binding configuration file
#
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
#
# Each non-comment line is a semicolon delimited list of values in the following format:
# au_name; blendshape_identifier; min_limit; max_limit; inverted [optional]; weight [optional]; filter_window [optional]; filter_amount [optional]
# 
# Optional parameters may be ommited, but only the last ones. For example, it is not possible to omit 'inverted' and 'weight' values and not omit 'filter_window' and 'filter_amount' values.
#
# Last two parameters (filter_window and filter_amount) control the smoothing filter. 
# This is similiar to the smoothing filter used in the tracker, but these can be defined for each action unit separately.
# Stronger filtering will stabilize the animation but can also introduce delay.
#
#
# Value descriptions:
# 
# au_name: 
# The name of the action unit used to drive the specified blendshape. 
# Example: "au_jaw_drop".
# 
# blendshape_identifier: 
# Platform-specific blendshape identifier. 
# Example for Unity-based implementations: "tina_face:1". 
# The part before the colon is the game object name with the SkinnedMeshRenderer component you wish to animate, the part after is the blendshape index.
# Example for HTML5-based implementations: "TODO".
# 
# min_limit: 
# Lower action unit limit. 
# Consult the action unit limits defined in the tracker configuration file for appropriate values. 
# Example: "-0.16".
# 
# max_limit: 
# Upper action unit limit. 
# Consult the action unit limits defined in the tracker configuration file for appropriate values. 
# Example: "0.51".
# 
# inverted: 
# Inverts the action unit values. 
# Valid values are "0" and "1". 
# Value of "1" means the action unit will be inverted. This is useful when a blendshape works in the direction opposite of the action unit.
# For example, action unit is "au_left_inner_brow_raiser" and the blendshape works by lowering the inner brow.
# Default value is "0".
# 
# weight: 
# Action unit weight. Action units are multiplied with this value. 
# Default value is "1.0".
# 
# filter_window: 
# Action unit history size used to filter values. 
# Valid value range are integers from "1" to "16". 
# Default value is "6".
# 
# filter_amount: 
# Strenght of the filter. 
# Valid value range is from "0.0" to "1.0". 
# Default value is "0.3".
